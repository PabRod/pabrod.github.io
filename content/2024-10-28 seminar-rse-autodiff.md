[Automatic differentiation](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/automatic-differentiation-from-scratch-23d50c699555) is one of those things I wish someone had told me about much earlier. On Nov 5th 2024 I'll be sharing my enthousiasm about it at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

## Title
A peek under the hood of automatic differentiation

## Abstract
There are many packages implementing automatic differentiation available for free. This is good news because, as an engineer, it saves me time and keeps me away from reinventing the wheel. But as a researcher, I'm curiosity driven. I want to know, at least partially, what the packages I use do. I want to share some basic pen-an-paper concepts that, I hope, will satisfy your curiosity, and even enable you to write a basic automatic differentiation engine from scratch.
