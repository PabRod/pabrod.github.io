## Title
Best practices for scientific programming, with a focus in testing

[![slides](images/2025-05/coding-cafe.png)][link to slides]

## Abstract
Software projects, big or small, have a lot of complexity.
Not only they perform complex tasks, but often they have thousands of lines and multiple authors.
To make things even more complicated, software projects are rarely static, but keep evolving in time.
How is all this complexity managed?
The answer is: by using best practices.

Chances are you've heard about best practices for researchers.
But did you know their primary purpose is to make **your** life easier?
Furthermore, did you know they are rooted at the very core of the scientific method?

We'll talk about these and other topics, and will focus our attention on a particularly useful practice: unit testing.

Join us if you want to know more.
And bring your laptop!
We'll cover the mechanics of **unit testing in both R and Python**.

And last but not least, there will be pizza! 🍕
