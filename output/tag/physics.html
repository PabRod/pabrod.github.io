</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><em>This text appeared first in <a href="http://fuga.naukas.com/2018/02/06/un-empollon-en-mi-ascensor/">Naukas</a>, where was originally written in Spanish.</em></p>
<p>Recently I started a secondment at the Friedrich Schiller University, in Jena, Germany. Surprisingly, my office during the next months is located in the 18th floor of a skyscraper. The Jentower in particular:</p>
<p><img alt="Jentower" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/2018-01-30-16.34.25-360x640.jpg"></p>
<p>But I'm not writing this to boast about the views of my new office. On the contrary, I'll destroy any possible idea of glamour related to work in a place like this. And I'll do it with a confession: I became the crazy guy who leaves his cell phone on the ground while he uses the elevator. Let me explain:</p>
<p>A building of almost 150 meters high needs fast elevators. The ones in this building have a very powerful, scary acceleration. Then, I remembered that smartphones usually contain an accelerometer, so I tried to measure those accelerations.</p>
<p>I used an app called <a href="https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com">Google Science Journal</a>, that allows registering data from all sensors available in the phone (accelerometers, light, magnetic field, ...) and export them in a format (.csv) quite easy to analyze on a computer. If you like getting your hands dirty, install it now!</p>
<p>In the figure below we can see the vertical acceleration profile during my trip to the 18th floor this morning, where we can clearly see the initial "kick" (seconds 9 to 14) and the braking (28 to 33)</p>
<p><img alt="accel" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/acel1-580x391.png">
Vertical acceleration (excluding gravity)</p>
<p>Accelerations of 1 m/s^2 sustained during 4 seconds! You can feel that in your stomach!</p>
<p>Using this data, we can explore a bit further. We can use a time series of the acceleration to compute speed and position. How? Maybe you remember from high school's physics that position, speed and acceleration are related through derivatives. More specifically.</p>
<p><img alt="diff" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/diff.png"></p>
<p>With the previous recipe we can compute speed using the position, and then use speed to compute acceleration. Like in a production chain. Nevertheless, in our case we want to do the opposite process. Luckily, we can use indefinite integrals to "revert" our derivatives, and thus our whole "production chain".</p>
<p><img alt="int" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/int.png"></p>
<p>So, by integrating the acceleration (to obtain the speed), and then integrating the speed (to obtain the position) we find results like this:</p>
<p><img alt="results" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/all-580x564.png">
Acceleration, speed and position</p>
<p>So, using only a device that most of us carry everywhere and some elementary physical concepts we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our elevator runs up at 4 m/s.</li>
<li>My office is 74 meter above the ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a great time to be a nerd!</p>
<p>If someone is interested in exploring a bit deeper into the details (for instance: how to filter out the effects of gravity, how to integrate a time series, ... ) or even experiment with his or her own elevator, <a href="https://github.com/PabRod/elevator-tool">here is a link</a> to the code I've used.</p>                    </article>
