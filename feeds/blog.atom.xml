&lt;p&gt;Recently I started a secondment at the Friedrich Schiller University, in Jena, Germany. Surprisingly, my office during the next months is located in the 18th floor of a skyscraper. The Jentower in particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jentower" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/2018-01-30-16.34.25-360x640.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm not writing this to boast about the views of my new office. On the contrary, I'll destroy any possible idea of glamour related to work in a place like this. And I'll do it with a confession: I became the crazy guy who leaves his cell phone on the ground while he uses the elevator. Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A building of almost 150 meters high needs fast elevators. The ones in this building have a very powerful, scary acceleration. Then, I remembered that smartphones usually contain an accelerometer, so I tried to measure those accelerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used an app called &lt;a href="https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com"&gt;Google Science Journal&lt;/a&gt;, that allows registering data from all sensors available in the phone (accelerometers, light, magnetic field, ...) and export them in a format (.csv) quite easy to analyze on a computer. If you like getting your hands dirty, install it now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure below we can see the vertical acceleration profile during my trip to the 18th floor this morning, where we can clearly see the initial "kick" (seconds 9 to 14) and the braking (28 to 33)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="accel" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/acel1-580x391.png" /&gt;
Vertical acceleration (excluding gravity)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerations of 1 m/s^2 sustained during 4 seconds! You can feel that in your stomach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this data, we can explore a bit further. We can use a time series of the acceleration to compute speed and position. How? Maybe you remember from high school's physics that position, speed and acceleration are related through derivatives. More specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="diff" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/diff.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the previous recipe we can compute speed using the position, and then use speed to compute acceleration. Like in a production chain. Nevertheless, in our case we want to do the opposite process. Luckily, we can use indefinite integrals to "revert" our derivatives, and thus our whole "production chain".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="int" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/int.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by integrating the acceleration (to obtain the speed), and then integrating the speed (to obtain the position) we find results like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="results" src="http://fuga.naukas.com/files/2018/02/all-580x564.png" /&gt;
Acceleration, speed and position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, using only a device that most of us carry everywhere and some elementary physical concepts we know that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our elevator runs up at 4 m/s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My office is 74 meter above the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a great time to be a nerd!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone is interested in exploring a bit deeper into the details (for instance: how to filter out the effects of gravity, how to integrate a time series, ... ) or even experiment with his or her own elevator, &lt;a href="https://github.com/PabRod/elevator-tool"&gt;here is a link&lt;/a&gt; to the code I've used.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="physics"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Welcome</title><link href="https://pabrod.github.io/pelican-test/welcome.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-23T12:24:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-04-23T12:24:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez</name></author><id>tag:pabrod.github.io,2018-04-23:/pelican-test/welcome.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Description of the motivations and topic of this blog&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Despite I have &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pablorodriguezsanchez/"&gt;a personal webpage&lt;/a&gt; in Google Sites since some years ago, I got tired of updating it. The main reason is that it was an extremely manual task, that forced me to copypaste the same pieces of information in several places. The virtue of lazyness, when well understood, is the mother of programming and automation, so I started exploring other possibilities. In particular, I wanted something that could be well integrated with &lt;a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/"&gt;knitr&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the blog &lt;a href="https://rinzewind.org/blog-en/"&gt;Will do stuff for stuff&lt;/a&gt; I discovered &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, that allows to create websites from local files in a relatively easy way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two main problems I face at the early days of this new website are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Archiving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some years working in science, I've produced a certain amount of materials that are now spread around at different webpages. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/"&gt;knitr&lt;/a&gt;, I can keep this registry updated while only keeping updated a Spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For details, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/PabRod/academic-record"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Translating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican gave me a nice surprise: it manages translations very well. This is specially relevant for me, because most of my work before my emigration to the Netherlands is written in Spanish. On the mid term, I hope to translate those materials whom I consider most relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What will I find here?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is easy: as in any other personal page, here you'll find anything the author considered worth being shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posts will be written in English, Spanish and/or, to a lesser extent, in Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="about"></category></entry></feed>
